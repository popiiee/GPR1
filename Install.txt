Windows Java Install Instructions
---------------------------------
We recommend OpenJDK 11 if you don't have an Oracle
license for Oracle Java.

Download OpenJDK here:  http://jdk.java.net/11/

Take the zip file and unzip it to its own folder named
"Java" in your CrushFTP folder.  Example:
CrushFTP9_PC\Java\bin\
CrushFTP9_PC\Java\conf\
CrushFTP9_PC\Java\lib\
.........

The CrushFTP exe will automatically search for this
folder when launching CrushFTP.

If you are using an old version of Windows, you may
need to install the VS C++ 2015 Redistributable
libraries.  Windows versions after Windows 7 won't
need to do this.
